# Gender Classfication Based on Eyes Using CNN

## Introduction
This research initiative adopts a pioneering stance within the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to discern gender exclusively through the intricate dynamics of the human gaze. In departing from conventional facial analysis, our study concentrates on the communicative nuances embedded in the eyes, offering a nuanced perspective on gender identification. Beyond its scientific implications, this project holds promise for practical applications in security, marketing, and human-computer interaction. The potential integration of gender identification into security systems or the personalization of advertisements based on subtle gaze cues illustrates the real-world impact of this innovative approach. By pursuing this trajectory, our aim is not only to propel the field of computer vision forward but also to contribute to a broader discourse concerning the harmonious convergence of technology and human identity.
